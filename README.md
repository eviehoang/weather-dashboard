Our application harnesses the power of the OpenWeather API to retrieve up-to-date weather and forecast data for cities across the United States.  Simply enter your preferred city and click "search" to access the latest weather conditions and a five-day forecast. Additionally, we store your previous searches in your local storage for quick and easy access, with search history conveniently available as buttons to facilitate re-examining weather and forecasts.
